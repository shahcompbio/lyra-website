Lyra is a web-based visualization dashboard for single-cell phylogeny.

It currently consists of three layers:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) front-end
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), powered by [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) database

## System Requirements

- ElasticSearch (version 6.2.3)
- pip
- virtualenv
- yarn or npm

## Installation Instructions

These instructions will show how to set up a local instance of Lyra. It assumes that you have the system requirements, as mentioned above.

### Setting up ElasticSearch

Extract the ElasticSearch archive, and add these to the config/elasticsearch.yml file to enable CORS

```
http.cors.enabled : true
http.cors.allow-origin : "*"
```

Then start the ElasticSearch instance

```
./bin/elasticsearch
```

You can verify that this has been set up correctly by `curl http://localhost:9200` and getting this response:

```
{
  "name" : "",
  "cluster_name" : "",
  "cluster_uuid" : "RsApHfPNQr2SLTQrC9f9Xg",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "6.2.3",
    "build_hash" : "c59ff00",
    "build_date" : "2018-03-13T10:06:29.741383Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "7.2.1",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

### Loading Data

Create a Python 2.7 virtualenv and install the required packages

```
virtualenv ~/pythonenv
source ~/pythonenv/bin/activate
pip install -r <MONTAGE_REPO_DIR>/loader/pip-requires.txt
```

Load using the appropriate dashboard loader with the correct YAML file. For example:

```
python tree_cellscape_loader.py -y directory/to/yaml/data_metadata.yaml
```

This will load an entry into the analysis index, as well as the appropriate data files. You can view the [Loading Section](load-overview.md) for more information about loading.

### Setting up graphQL

Clone the [Lyra graphQL](https://github.com/shahcompbio/lyra-graphql) repository and install the necessary dependencies, then start development mode.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Following the URL `http://localhost:4000` should bring you to the GraphQL playground, where you can enter queries.

### Setting up front-end

Clone the [front-end](https://github.com/shahcompbio/lyra) repository and install the necessary dependencies, then start development mode.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

It should automatically open up a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. If not, go to that webpage and you should see Lyra.
