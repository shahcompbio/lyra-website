- To create a single cell phylogenetics dashboard
- To enable students to use our product without cumbersome installation instructions

## Background and strategic fit

As more and more cells get sequenced, once immediate analysis that can be done is to see how these cells are related to one another. However, these trees often consist of thousands of cells, and current visualizations do not support drawing to this scale and retaining some level of interactivity.

We have done a prototype of a tree and copy number heatmap visualization, that scales to thousands of cells. As more users adopt it, we have taken their feedback and feature requests and will aim to get a new version released.

To aid user adoption, we will also strive to improve the ease of installing and using our products.
