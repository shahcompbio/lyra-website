2. [[Stories](us-tree.md)] Tree representation for thousands of cells
3. [[Stories](us-heatmap.md)] Heatmap (CN, SNV, breakpoint, corrupt tree output) accompanies tree
4. [[Stories](us-loader.md)] Interface to load data into database
5. [[Stories](us-deploy.md)] Contained end-to-end product

## Non-Functional

1. Responsive and real-time interactions
2. Views are able to be compartmentalized
3. Unit tests
4. Flexible to different screen sizes larger than the minimum.
